### Role - Solo Developer
### Engine/Platform - Unreal Engine 5 (Windows)
### Practiced Skills - C++, Melee Combat, Enemy AI

Slash is an Unreal Engine 5 project from an online course (UE5 Ultimate C++) where I learned a lot about how to use C++ with Unreal Engine. This is a solo project course and the main mechanic of the project is melee combat. Gameplay mechanics like swinging a sword and having it hit things as well as animation canceling between attacks/moves. A key takeaway from this course was that there is a lot of documentation on how to use the engine and there are many things already done by Epic in order to make lives of developers easier.

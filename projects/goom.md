title: 'Goom'
---
Goom was made in the Spring of 2023 in the University of Utah's Traditional Game Development course (EAE 3710). This game is a Isometric slime game that drew inspiration from games like: Tunic, Death's Door, and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. There were 7 team members and 2 addition outside helpers. I worked on this game as the lead programmer for the gameplay aspects. On this game, things I implemented were: the projectile shooting mechanic, elemental interactions, player ability system, logic puzzle states, enemy combat, and blending between cinematics and gameplay. All of these were implemented using Blueprints due to the majority of the team being new to Unreal Engine at the time.

title: 'Save The Animals'
---

Save the Animals was made in the Summer of 2023 in the University of Utah's Alternative Game Development course (EAE 3720). The game was made with the intent to try to bring awareness towards animal testing. The team consisted of 9 team members. I worked on this game as the lead gameplay/UI progammer. I implemented the modular ability system and each individual ability, physics interactions, puzzle mechanics, main menu/pause/HUD UI, and enemy AI. This game was solely implemented using Unreal Engine's Blueprints due to the time constraint of the Summer semester in order to quickly iterate on the game mechanics.

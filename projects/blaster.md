Blaster is an Unreal Engine 5 project from an online course (UE5 Multiplayer Shooter) where I am learning how to create a fully online networked 3rd person multiplayer shooter. This is a solo project course. The project is implemented in C++ and uses Blueprints to allow designers and other team members to easily modify variables without modifying the underlying code.

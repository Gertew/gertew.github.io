title: 'Blaster'

Blaster is an Unreal Engine 5 project from an online course (UE5 Multiplayer Shooter) where I am learning how to create a fully online networked 3rd person multiplayer shooter. This is a solo project course. The project is implemented in C++ and uses Blueprints to easily modify variables on assets derived from their C++ class. The project features 3 game modes: Free For All, Team Deathmatch, and Capture The Flag.

This project uses Steam to handle connecting players together. If Steam is not opened then the project defaults it to a LAN match.

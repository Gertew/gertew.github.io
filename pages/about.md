        <p style="margin:10px;">    I love it when games allow their players to crazy and explore game mechanics. I am currently a Senior at the University of Utah and currently majoring in Computer Science with Entertainment Arts & Engineering Emphasis. I started actively working and programming for games during my Junior year of college. I have become very interested in playing more games to have a deeper understanding of their mechanics and how they work.</p>

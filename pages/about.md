Gameplay is what keeps me engaged with games. I love it when games allow their players to express themselves through game mechanics. I am currently a Senior at the University of Utah and currently majoring in Computer Science with Entertainment Arts & Engineering Emphasis. I started actively working and programming for games during my Junior year of college. I have become very interested in playing more games to have a deeper understanding of their mechanics and how they work.

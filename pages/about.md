  I'm William Nguyen, a gameplay programmer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah, eager to break into the games industry.

  I am proficient in **C++**, **C#**, **Unreal Engine**, and **Perforce**. I enjoy designing and implementing gameplay mechanics and abilities. I am particular fond of character-based action games and like spending my time exploring how they were implemented.

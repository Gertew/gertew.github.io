        <h8 style="margin:25px;">I remember having a Nintendo DS and Playstation Portable. I played Pokemon Emerald all the time but couldn't complete the Pokedex. My 6 year old brain only knew to spam Surf and throw Ultra Balls in every battle so finding any of the hidden pokemon wasn't possible at the time. Looking back I realized that I had so much fun even though I wasn't even fully interacting with all the mechanics. A few years later I remember getting a Nintendo Wii for Christmas and playing Wii Sports using the motion controls. This was uncomprehensible for my 9 year old brain. I was no longer just simply pressing buttons. I was jumping and swinging my arms around in my living room while boxing which annoyed my parents. My parents began forcing me do my homework first before I could start playing afterschool. This really motivated me to get my homework done but at the same time made me daydream about the things I could try when I started playing again to see if they worked. Ever since then I wanted to play more games and figure out how they worked as my parents only allowed me to play "kid" games.</h8>
        <h8 style="margin:25px;">A genre of games that I fell in love with was the action genre. Games like Devil May Cry, God of War, and the Batman Arkham series were exhilarating, intense, and challenging. They rewarded fast on the fly thinking and had deep combat systems. I never had to keep track of so many things all at the same time before. I'm really interested in creating game mechanics/systems that offer lots of depth and especially replayability as I love going back to these older games and trying to dissect their mechanics. What made them good and bad? Do they still hold up when compared to modern games? How did they implement it? These are the types of questions I am asking myself while finish my Senior year at the University of Utah. I am currently majoring in Computer Science with Entertainment Arts & Engineering Emphasis with hopes to become a gameplay engineer.</h8>

        <h4 style="display: block; padding-right:25px;">When writing code it should be written in such a way that others can comprehend what is going on. I try to abide by this rule and when I cannot I will place comments on what it is doing. While it is necessary to be writing good code, it is very helpful to have visual representation of the code in action. I will record video and take pictures of my code running in order to get feedback from my teammates to see if I am heading in the right direction.</h4>

Models/animations are created in various 3D software where it defines their shapes, bone structures, and UV layouts. Textures/materials are created using digital content creation tools like Photoshop/Substance Painter and then are applied to the models.</h4>

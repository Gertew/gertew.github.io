        <h8 style="margin:25px;">I've been playing video games ever since I was a kid. I remember having a Nintendo DS and Playstation Portable, which I always played in my free time. I have a vivid memory of me playing Pokemon Emerald and mashing the A button everytime I threw a Poke Ball, thinking it would improve my chances of success. I recall my hand hurting the next day, and I couldn't press as hard when playing. Looking back, I realize that I had so much fun, even though my actions were completely unncessary and potentially damaging to my DS. I made up some mechanic in my mind and believed in it so strongly that it caused my hand to hurt. The joy and imagination I experienced are what I want to share with others. The magic of video games has brought me to where I am today on my journey to become a game developer.</h8>

        <h8 style="margin:25px;">A genre of games that I've really fallen in love with is the character action genre. Games like Devil May Cry, God of War, and the Batman Arkham series are exhilarating, intense, and challenging. The combat in these games reward players for reacting quickly and making the right moves in the moment. The rush I feel when playing these types of games is something I don't experience in other genres. I want to continue honing on my skills and, someday, create an action game that stands side by side with the ones I hold so dear and that others can enjoy. Video games are very much a shared experienced, after all.</h8>

        <h8 style="margin:25px;">I remember having a Nintendo DS and Playstation Portable. I played Pokemon Emerald all the time but couldn't complete the Pokedex. My 6 year old brain only knew to spam Surf and throw Ultra Balls in every battle so finding any of the hidden pokemon wasn't possible at the time. Looking back I realized that I had so much fun even though I wasn't even fully interacting with all the mechanics. A few years later I remember getting a Nintendo Wii for Christmas and playing Wii Sports using the motion controls. This was uncomprehensible for my 9 year old brain. I was no longer just simply pressing buttons. I was jumping and swinging my arms around in my living room while boxing which annoyed my parents. My parents began forcing me do my homework first before I could start playing afterschool. This really motivated me to get my homework done but at the same time made me daydream about the things I could try when I started playing again to see if they worked. Ever since then I wanted to play more games and figure out how they worked as my parents only allowed me to play "kid" games.</h8>

        <h8 style="margin:25px;">A genre of games that I fell in love with was the action genre. Games like Devil May Cry, God of War, and the Batman Arkham series were exhilarating, intense, and challenging. They rewarded fast on the fly thinking and had deep combat systems. I never had to keep track of so many things all at the same time before. I'm really interested in creating game mechanics/systems that offer lots of depth and especially replayability as I love going back to these older games and trying to dissect their mechanics. What made them good and bad? Do they still hold up when compared to modern games? How did they implement it? These are the types of questions I am asking myself while finish my Senior year at the University of Utah. I am currently majoring in Computer Science with Entertainment Arts & Engineering Emphasis with hopes to become a gameplay engineer.</h8>

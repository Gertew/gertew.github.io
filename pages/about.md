  Hi, I'm William Nguyen, a gameplay programmer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah, eager to break into the games industry.

  I experience with **C++**, **C#**, **Python**, **Unreal Engine**, **Perforce**, and **Git**.
  
  I enjoy designing and implementing gameplay mechanics and abilities. I am particularly fond of character-based action games and like spending my time exploring how they are implemented, especially how they empower the player and fulfill the power fantasy.

  I am extremely proud of all the projects I have been a part of and the diverse group of people I had the opportunity to work with during my academic career. I look forward to creating even more memorable moments with new colleagues and connecting through our shared passion for games.
